ASL Gesture Recognition System

1. Accessibility for Spelling Out Words:
    * Non-ASL users can spell out words letter by letter using ASL hand signs.
    * Example: If someone spells "H-E-L-L-O," the system can recognize each letter and display the word in text form.
2. Learning and Practice Tool:
    * Beginners can use this project to learn the ASL alphabet.
    * ASL learners can check their hand positioning and gestures in real time.
